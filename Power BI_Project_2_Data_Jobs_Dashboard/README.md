Performed data cleaning and transformation by handling missing values, adjusting data types, and preparing the dataset with calculated columns, calculated tables, parameters, and explicit measures for deeper analysis.

Explicit & Implicit Measures
Created both implicit measures (e.g., Job Count) and explicit measures (e.g., Median Yearly Salary) to deliver meaningful KPIs and highlight critical market trends.

Core Visualizations
Implemented a variety of charts—including Column, Bar, Line, and Area Charts—to compare job counts and track changes across different time periods.

Geospatial Analysis
Used Map Charts to visualize the global distribution of data jobs, providing a clear geographical perspective.

KPI Indicators & Data Tables
Displayed essential metrics through Cards for high-level KPIs, while incorporating Tables to present detailed, sortable data for user-driven exploration.

Dashboard Design
Designed a user-friendly and visually engaging layout, integrating both standard and unconventional chart types to communicate the data story effectively.

Interactive Reporting

Slicers: Enabled dynamic filtering by Job Title for enhanced user analysis.

The second version of the Data Jobs Dashboard builds upon the first by consolidating the analysis into a single, streamlined page that delivers the most essential insights at a glance. Serving as a central hub for exploring the data job market, the dashboard highlights critical KPIs such as **Job Count, Skills per Job, Median Yearly Salary, and Median Hourly Salary.** It also provides a clear view of **skill popularity**—whether measured by percentage or count—and enables comparisons of **salaries across job titles**, ensuring users can quickly grasp market dynamics in an efficient and accessible way.

Through this iteration, I advanced my Power BI skills by learning to work with explicit measures, calculated columns, calculated tables, and parameters. This experience strengthened my ability to transform complex datasets into actionable insights, while also enhancing my proficiency in designing professional, interactive dashboards. These skills are not only reflected in the functionality of this project but also form a strong foundation for my growth in the field of data analytics.

### **Conclusion**

The Data Jobs Dashboard v2.0 reflects my growing ability to use Power BI as more than just a visualization tool—it’s a platform to transform raw job posting data into meaningful, actionable insights. By consolidating key metrics and interactive features into a single-page design, this project empowers users to efficiently explore salary trends, skill demand, and job opportunities. For me, it also represents a significant step forward in applying Power BI to real-world career analysis, strengthening the skills I’ll continue to build on in my data analytics journey.
